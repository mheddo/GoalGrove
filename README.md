# 🌳 GoalGrove
Plant your final goal. Grow it into action.

# 🌟 What is GoalGrove?
GoalGrove is a minimal, offline-first app that helps you break down ambitious goals into manageable, actionable steps — like growing a tree from the root upward.

But here's the twist:
Just like a writer crafting a compelling story, you start at the end — your big goal — and work backward. Every major milestone branches into prerequisite goals, which break down further into smaller, simpler tasks. Before you know it, your vision becomes a concrete, step-by-step action plan.

# ✨ Why GoalGrove?
🌿 Think like a storyteller – Work backward from your ending to plan the journey.

🧠 Clarity through structure – Visualize goals and their dependencies in a clean tree view.

📶 Offline-first – Your goals live on your device. No sign-ins. No distractions.

🔄 Iterative planning – Refine and reorganize your goals as your path evolves.

🌱 From vision to action – Zoom in from abstract dreams to the next small task.

# 🛠 Features (Coming Soon)

💾 Local data storage — nothing leaves your device
